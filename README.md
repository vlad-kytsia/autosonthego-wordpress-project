## 📝 Project Description

This project involved building a **custom WordPress theme from scratch** for a multi-page website with a blog.

I developed the full HTML/CSS/JavaScript front-end and integrated it into WordPress as a custom theme.
Dynamic content was implemented using **Custom Fields**.

For form management, I used **Gravity Forms**.
SEO optimization was handled with **Yoast SEO**.
Accessibility improvements were implemented using **Accessibility by UserWay**.

Additionally, I created **custom Gutenberg elements** and a **custom page template** where content is managed via the Gutenberg editor. This allows flexible content editing while preserving the design structure.

The website was also fully populated with content and tested across devices for responsiveness.
